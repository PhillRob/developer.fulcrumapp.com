The Query API provides read-only access to interact with your Fulcrum tables and data (records, repeatables, choice lists, members, media, etc.). This endpoint supports most standard [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database functions, including many advanced spatial types supported by the [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) extension. This enables real-time data analytics and integrating Fulcrum with a variety of Business Intelligence services and other platforms, as well as programmatically scripting custom data exports.

The [introduction](/query-api/intro/), [reference](/query-api/reference/), and [examples](/query-api/examples/) have been included in a separate expanded section.
