## Introduction

The Query API provides read-only access to interact with your Fulcrum tables and data (records, repeatables, choice lists, members, media, etc.). This endpoint supports most standard [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database functions, including many advanced spatial types supported by the [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) extension. This enables real-time data analytics and integrating Fulcrum with a variety of Business Intelligence services and other platforms, as well as programmatically scripting custom data exports.

We also have two repositories on GitHub for allowing you to query and export your data via the [command line](https://github.com/fulcrumapp/fq) and on the web through a [query utility](https://github.com/fulcrumapp/fulcrum-query-utility).

## Reference

Check out the full documentation on required parameters, formatting calls, responses and functions by browsing the [Reference](/query-api/reference/) section.

## Functional Examples

We have a [library of examples](/query-api/examples/) available for learning what you can do with the Query API.
